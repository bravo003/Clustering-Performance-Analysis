# Clustering Performance Analysis with PyCaret

## Introduction
This repository contains an introductory exploration into clustering performance analysis using PyCaret, a low-code machine learning library in Python. The dataset utilized in this analysis is the Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
## Prerequisites
Make sure to install the required Python packages using the following commands:

```bash
pip install ucimlrepo
pip install pycaret
```

## Contents
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The main analysis is presented in a Jupyter Notebook, detailing the step-by-step process of clustering performance analysis using PyCaret.
- **Results**: Visualizations and insights derived from the clustering analysis are included to facilitate understanding and interpretation.
  
## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Before running the notebook, ensure all required libraries and dependencies are installed.
3. **Run the Notebook**: Execute the Jupyter Notebook to reproduce the clustering analysis and explore the results.
4. **Customization**: Feel free to modify the notebook or extend the analysis according to your requirements.


## Configurations
The code explores the following preprocessing configurations:
- No Data Processing
- Using Normalization
- Using Transform
- Using PCA
- T+N (Transform + Normalize)
- T+N+PCA (Transform + Normalize + PCA)
